            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THis day the Grand Jury for the City of <hi>London,</hi> being Summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Vertue of a special Commission, made their Appearance at the Sessions-House in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> where after they were Sworn, Sir <hi>S. Bernardiston</hi> being Foreman, a Bill of Indictment for High-Treason against <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Presented to them, the which, after my Lord Chief Justice had given the Charge, was Read, Importing, that the said Earl had Tratorously and Maliciously conspired the compassing the Death of his Majesty, him to Depose, and put to final Destruction, by raising Armes, and leavying War within his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which a Paper was produced, Importing several Designes against his Majesties Person and Government: As likewise a kind of an Oath or solemn Covenant to be taken by such as were to enter into the Confederacy for opposing the Succession, which Paper was Sworn to be found in the Earls Closet by Mr. <hi>Guinn,</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council, and sealed up in his Trunk on the 6th of <hi>July</hi> last, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>Lyonel Jenkins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blackwaite</hi> gave Evidence, that it was the same Paper that they had before seen, which came out of the Earls Trunk; then after the Jury had made Objections against the Witnesses being Examined in open Court, and had been over-rule in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Mr. <hi>John Booth</hi> was called and Sworn, the rest not being permitted to come within hearing; he gave in Evidence, that he having had access to the Earls presence, by the means of Captain <hi>Wilkinson,</hi> a little before
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54425:2"/>the sitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> he told him, that having well considered the Elections, he found they would insist upon the Bill of Exclusion; The Repealing the 35 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the bringing in a Bill for Uniting the Protestant Dissenters, which he knew the King would not consent to, and therefore it was resolved, to compel him to it, and for that purpose, most of the Members would come Armed, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was to have Fifty Gentlemen, which he designed should be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>VVilkinson,</hi> and that Captain <hi>VVilkinson</hi> told him, if he would List himself under him, he must provide him with Horse and Armes, and that he would provide his Man with a Horse, the which he declared was done: The other witnesses were <hi>John Smith, Edward Ivy, Edward Turbervil, Brian Haines, John Macknamarra, Dennis Macknamarra, Bernard Dennis</hi> who Evidenc'd that the Earl at several times imparted to them Treasonable designs, tending to the Deposing of his Majesty, and to reduce the Kingdome to a Common-wealth, after the manner of <hi>Holland;</hi> and that for that purpose, several persons would Arm; the Rable being resolute on their side, and a great number of Gentry who would cut in pieces the Mercinary Guards, and then take from his Majesty such Lords as at that time he mentioned, saying they Evilly advised his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and that unless such means were used, Popery would Enevitably be Introduced and that it now stood the People of <hi>England</hi> upon to stand for their Liberties: that his Majesty might be Deposed as King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was, he having taken such like Measures, or to that effect. Farther, it was Sworn that his Lordship should say, that his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (in the Right of his Mother) ought to be Baron of <hi>Ross,</hi> and had as good a Title to the Crown, as the Descent of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> or to that effect. Many other passages were Sworn to, too tedious here to Incert. When the Evidence had been Examined, the Jury withdrew for some time, to consider the particulars, when returning, they desired to Examine the Evidence one by one, which was granted by the Court, whereupon they were called in order, and Cross Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to what they had Sworn, in which they little vary'd. When they had been Examined for the space of two hours, the Jury desired to have the Statute Book, to peruse the Statutes of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the third and that of the 13 of his present Majesty, which was granted, and then went out again to debate the matter upon the whole Evidence, but stay'd not above the space of an hour and a half before they returned, and brought in the Bill <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> upon which a very great Shout was given, and upon the complaint of the Evidence that they were in danger of their Lives, the Court ordered the Sheriffs to send for a Guard to Conduct them safe to their Habitations, and so ended these remakable proceedings.</p>
